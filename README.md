# SysSec ETHZ

This repository contains my solutions to the three assignements proposed in System Security in Fall Semester 2022. 

### Assignment 1
The goal of this exercise is to understand and perform a simple multi-step exploit that leverages a set of known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, to be exploited both manually and through automated tools (Metaspoit). See the handout for details. 

The solution is written in the provided pdf template. Grade: 6/6

### Assignment 2
The goal of this exercise is to reverse engineer and understand the internal functioning of a binary distributed to the students. Tools like Ghidra, IDA and Z3 solver are employed. See the handout for details. 

The solution is written in the provided pdf template. Grade: 6/6

### Assignment 3
The goal of this exercise is to implement a simple protocol using Intel SGX enclaves. See the handout for details. 
> The code has not been cleaned and the implementation it is meant to be perfectly secure (e.g. IV in AES is not random) 

Grade: 6/6
